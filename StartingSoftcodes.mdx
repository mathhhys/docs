title: "Setting up Softcodes"
description: "When you sign up for Softcodes, you’ll receive 500 free credits that you can use with the Softcodes provider."

## Starting with Softcodes

- **Sign up**: Complete the registration process
- **Dashboard**: Go to your dashboard and copy your **auth token**
- **Sign in**: Paste the token directly in **VS Code** to get signed in (use `softcodes.signin` or the little profile button in the extension)

## Using BYOK ( Bring Your Own Key)

If you prefer to use your own API provider instead of Softcodes:

1. Open **Settings** in the Softcodes extension
2. Select **API Providers**
3. Choose your provider
4. Enter your **API key**

## Credit Consumption

When you receive your **500 free credits**, keep in mind that different models consume tokens at different rates. Some models are more efficient, while others—like **Claude Opus 4.1**—are much more resource-intensive and can quickly use up your credits. If you run out, you can easily \*\*add more credits directly from your dashboard at \*\*[**softcodes.ai**](http://softcodes.ai). All usage is billed at the **standard API prices with no markup**, so you only pay exactly what the underlying provider charges.

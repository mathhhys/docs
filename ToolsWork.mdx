| Category | Purpose                                        | Tool Names                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read     | Access file content and explore code structure | read_file, search_files, list_files, list_code_definition_names   |
| Edit     | Create or modify files and code                | write_to_file, apply_diff                                         |
| Execute  | Run commands and perform system operations     | execute_command                                                   |
| Browser  | Interact with web content                      | browser_action                                                    |
| Workflow | Manage task progress and context               | ask_followup_question, attempt_completion, switch_mode, newt_task |

## Example: Using Tools

Here’s a typical interaction with Softcodes tools:

_The tool approval interface displays “Save” and “Reject” buttons, along with an optional Auto-approve checkbox._

**Scenario:** Create a file named `greeting.js` that logs a greeting message.

1. **User:** Requests the file creation.
2. **Softcodes:** Suggests using the `write_to_file` tool.

```
<write_to_file>
<path>greeting.js</path>
<content>
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
</content>
<line_count>5</line_count>
</write_to_file>
```

3. **User:** Clicks **Save** in the interface.
4. **Softcodes:** Confirms the file has been created successfully.

## Tool Safety and Approval

Every tool action requires your explicit confirmation. When a tool is suggested, you’ll see:

- **Save** – approve and execute the tool.
- **Reject** – decline the proposed tool.
- **Auto-approve** – optionally allow trusted operations to run automatically.

This safeguard ensures you retain control over:

- Which files are created or modified
- Which commands are executed
- How the codebase changes

Always review proposed tools carefully before approving.

## Core Tools Reference

| Tool Name                      | Description                                       | Category |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| **read_file**                  | Reads file content with line numbers              | Read     |
| **search_files**               | Searches files for text or regex patterns         | Read     |
| **list_files**                 | Lists files and directories at a given path       | Read     |
| **list_code_definition_names** | Lists code definitions (classes, functions, etc.) | Read     |
| **write_to_file**              | Creates new files or overwrites existing ones     | Edit     |
| **apply_diff**                 | Applies precise changes to specific sections      | Edit     |
| **execute_command**            | Runs commands in the terminal                     | Execute  |
| **browser_action**             | Performs operations in a headless browser         | Browser  |
| **ask_followup_question**      | Prompts you for additional clarification          | Workflow |
| **attempt_completion**         | Marks the task as complete                        | Workflow |
| **switch_mode**                | Changes Softcodes to a different operational mode | Workflow |
| **new_task**                   | Creates a subtask with a defined starting mode    | Workflow |

This format ensures **Softcodes** actions are both **transparent and safe**, while still allowing fast, efficient interaction with its tools.

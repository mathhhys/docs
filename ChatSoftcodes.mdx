title: "Chat with Softcodes"
description: "Softcodes is your AI coding assistant inside VS Code. You chat with it in plain language, and it can write, edit, and explain code for you."
---

## Quick Setup

- Look for the **Softcodes icon** () in VS Code’s Primary Side Bar. Click it to open the chat panel.
- Can’t find it? Go to **View \> Open View…** and search for **“Softcodes”**.

## How to talk to Softcodes ? 

**Key idea:** Just type what you want in normal language—no special commands needed.

### Good Example Requests : 

- `Create a new React component called Card in @src/components/Card.tsx with a title and description props`
- `In @src/styles/global.css, change the font for all headings to Roboto`
- `Search @src/utils/helpers.js for functions containing "async" and add JSDoc comments describing their behavior`
- `Refactor the function calculateDiscount in @src/services/pricing.js to use arrow functions and simplify logic`
- `Add a unit test for the fetchUserData function in @tests/user.test.js`

### Tips for Effective Requests:

1. **Be specific** – `"Fix the bug in calculateTotal that returns incorrect results"` is better than `"Fix the code"`
2. **Use @ mentions** – Reference files and code directly with `@filename`
3. **One task at a time** – Break complex work into smaller steps
4. **Include examples** – Show the style or format you want

### Common Mistakes to avoid

| Instead of…                      | Try this                                                         |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"Fix the code"`                 | `"Fix the bug in calculateTotal that returns incorrect results"` |
| Assuming Softcodes knows context | Use `@` to reference specific files                              |
| Multiple unrelated tasks         | Submit one focused request at a time                             |
| Technical jargon overload        | Use clear, straightforward language                              |

**Why it matters:** Softcodes works best when you communicate like you’re talking to a smart teammate who needs clear instructions.

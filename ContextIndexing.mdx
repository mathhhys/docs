title: "Context & Indexing"
description: "Context mentions are a powerful way to provide an assistant with specific information about a project, making responses more accurate and efficient. Mentions can refer to files, folders, problems, terminal output, Git commits, and even external URLs. All mentions begin with the @ symbol."

### Overview

Typing **@** in the chat input opens a dropdown menu of available mentions. These can then be selected to insert project-related content directly into the conversation.

### Types of Mentions

### File Mentions

File mentions insert the contents of a file into the conversation for direct reference.

- **Format:** `@/path/to/file.ts`
- **Provides:** File contents with line numbers
- **Supports:** Text files, PDFs, and DOCX files (text extracted)
- **Best for:** Requesting explanations, debugging, or analysis of specific code
- **Limitation:** Very large files may be truncated; binary files not supported

**Example:**\
_"Explain the function in @/src/utils.ts"_

### Folder Mentions

Folder mentions display the structure of a directory in a tree format.

- **Format:** `@/path/to/folder/` (include trailing slash)
- **Provides:** Immediate child files and directories in tree form
- **Best for:** Understanding project layout
- **Tip:** Combine with file mentions for deeper inspection

**Example:**\
_"What files are in @/src/components/?"_

### Problem Mentions

Problems mentions insert diagnostic errors and warnings from the projectâ€™s environment.

- **Format:** `@problems`
- **Provides:** Errors and warnings with file paths, line numbers, and messages
- **Groups:** Organized by file for clarity
- **Best for:** Fixing issues without manual copy-pasting

**Example:**\
_"@problems Fix all errors in my code"_

### Terminal Mentions

Terminal mentions capture recent command execution and output.

- **Format:** `@terminal`
- **Provides:** Last command and its output
- **Preserves:** Current terminal state
- **Best for:** Debugging build errors or analyzing command results
- **Limitation:** Limited to visible terminal buffer

**Example:**\
_"Fix the errors shown in @terminal"_

### Git Mentions

Git mentions allow referencing commits or uncommitted changes.

- **Commit**
  - **Format:** `@<commit-hash>`
  - **Provides:** Commit message, author, date, and diff
- **Working Changes**
  - **Format:** `@git-changes`
  - **Provides:** Output of `git status` and diff of uncommitted changes
- **Limitation:** Only works inside Git repositories

**Example:**\
_"What changed in commit @a1b2c3d?"_

### URL Mentions

URL mentions fetch and convert website content into Markdown format for use in the conversation.

- **Format:** `@https://example.com`
- **Processing:** Fetches page content with scripts/styles removed
- **Output:** Markdown for readability
- **Limitation:** Complex pages may not render perfectly

**Example:**\
_"Summarize @_[_https://docusaurus.io/_](https://docusaurus.io/)_"_

### How to Use Mentions

1. Type **@** in the chat input to trigger the dropdown.
2. Filter by typing or navigate with arrow keys.
3. Select with **Enter** or mouse click.
4. Combine multiple mentions for more complex requests.

**Example:**\
_"Fix @problems in @/src/component.ts using the pattern from commit @a1b2c3d"_

The dropdown suggests:

- Recently opened files
- Visible folders
- Recent Git commits
- Special keywords (`problems`, `terminal`, `git-changes`)

### Best Practices

- **Use specific paths:** Reference exact files instead of describing them
- **Start from workspace root:** e.g., `@/src/file.ts`, not `@C:/Projects/src/file.ts`
- **Verify references:** Ensure paths and commit hashes are correct
- **Click mentions in chat history:** Quickly open or view referenced files
- **Avoid copy-paste:** Mentions reduce manual steps
- **Combine mentions:** Use multiple mentions for richer context

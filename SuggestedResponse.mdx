description: "When Softcodes needs additional details to move forward on a task, it can trigger the ask_followup_question feature. To make replying faster and more convenient, Softcodes may display suggested responses directly beneath its question."

## Overview

Suggested responses appear as clickable buttons under the follow-up question in the chat window. Each button contains a pre-written answer that relates to the query, giving you an easy way to respond without typing everything out manually.

## How It Works

1. **Question Asked**: Softcodes raises a follow-up question using its built-in tool.
2. **Suggestions Shown**: If available, a set of relevant answers appear as buttons below the message.
3. **Interaction**: You can either click a suggestion directly or edit it before sending.

## Interacting with Suggestions

You have two main ways to use these quick answers:

### 1. Direct Selection

- **Action**: Click on the button with the response you want.
- **Result**: Your chosen answer is instantly sent back to Softcodes.
- **Use case**: Perfect when one of the suggestions already matches exactly what you want to say.

### 2. Edit Before Sending

- **Action**:
  - Hold **Shift** while clicking the suggestion button, **or**
  - Hover over a button and click the **pencil icon** to copy it into the input box.
- **Result**: The suggestion is placed into the chat field where you can adjust the text before sending.
- **Use case**: Helpful when the suggestion is close but needs slight modification to fit your intent.

## Benefits of Suggested Responses

- **Speed**: Save time by choosing a response instead of typing from scratch.
- **Clarity**: The provided suggestions highlight the type of input Softcodes is expecting.
- **Flexibility**: You can edit and refine suggestions so they match your exact answer.

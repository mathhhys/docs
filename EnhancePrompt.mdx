## Why Use Enhance Prompt?

- **Improved Clarity**: Softcodes can rephrase your prompt to make it easier for the AI model to understand.
- **Added Context**: The enhancement process can include relevant information, such as the current file path or selected code.
- **Better Instructions**: Softcodes can insert guidance to help the AI generate more useful responses (e.g., specific formatting or a particular level of detail).
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Ensures Softcodes interprets your intent accurately.
- **Consistency**: Prompts are formatted consistently before being sent to the AI.

## How to Use Enhance Prompt

1. **Type Your Initial Prompt**\
   Enter your request in the Softcodes chat input box as usual. This could be a simple question, a complex task description, or anything in between.
2. **Click the Icon**\
   Instead of pressing Enter, click the icon at the bottom-right of the chat input.
3. **Review the Enhanced Prompt**\
   Softcodes replaces your original prompt with the enhanced version. Check that it accurately reflects your intent. You can further adjust the text if needed.
4. **Send the Enhanced Prompt**\
   Press Enter or click the Send icon to submit the refined prompt to Softcodes.

## Customizing the Enhancement Process

### Customizing the Template

The Enhance Prompt feature uses a **customizable prompt template**, which you can modify for your workflow.

1. **Open the Prompts Tab**: Click the ⚙️ icon in the Softcodes top menu bar.
2. **Select the “ENHANCE” Tab**: You’ll see all available support prompts. Click on “ENHANCE.”
3. **Edit the Prompt Template**: Modify the text in the “Prompt” field.

The default template includes the placeholder `${userInput}`, which will be replaced by your original prompt. You can adjust this to match your preferred prompt format and instruct the AI how to enhance your request.

### Customizing the Provider

For faster results at lower cost, you can switch to a lightweight LLM provider (e.g., GPT 4.1 Nano) for prompt enhancement.

- Create a dedicated profile for Enhance Prompt using the API configuration profiles guide.

## Limitations and Best Practices

- **Experimental Feature**: Prompt enhancement is experimental, and results may vary depending on request complexity and model capabilities.
- **Review Carefully**: Always check the enhanced prompt before sending—Softcodes may make changes that don’t match your intention.
- **Iterative Refinement**: You can apply Enhance Prompt multiple times to progressively improve a prompt.
- **Not a Substitute for Clear Instructions**: Start with clear, specific prompts; Enhance Prompt is a refinement tool, not a replacement for well-formed requests.

Using the **Enhance Prompt** feature helps you improve the quality and effectiveness of your prompts in Softcodes, leading to more accurate, helpful, and consistent AI responses.

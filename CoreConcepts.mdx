## Provider

Softcodes provides access to the latest frontier coding models without the need to manage API keys, including models from OpenAI (GPT-5), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Meta (Llama), and more. Users receive free credits based on their subscription plans, and Softcodes also offers a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) solution for added flexibility.

## Foundational Models

Large-scale AI models, trained on massive datasets, form the foundation of modern AI applications. Models such as GPT, Claude, and LLaMA deliver advanced language understanding and generation capabilities that power a wide range of use cases.

## Enhanced Prompt

The art and science of designing effective prompts to guide AI models toward the desired outputs. Use the **Enhance** button to instantly improve your prompt.

## Modes

Within Softcodes, you can switch between powerful modes to streamline your development workflow: **Architect** to plan and design your software, **Code** to write and refactor, **Ask** to explore and understand your codebase, **Debug** to identify and resolve issues, and **Orchestrator** to coordinate tasks across all modes.

## Advanced Codebase Indexing

Advanced codebase indexing powers deep semantic search across your entire project, leveraging AI embeddings to help you quickly navigate, understand, and retrieve relevant code.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A standardized protocol that manages context and communication between AI models and external systems, enabling seamless integration with tools, databases, and services.

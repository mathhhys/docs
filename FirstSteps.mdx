## Extension vs. API Provider

### Softcodes Extension

- Installed from the VS Code Marketplace
- Manages UI, file operations, and workflows
- Fully open source
- Compatible with **any provider**

### Softcodes API Provider (Built-in)

- Integrated with the extension
- Sign in to Softcodes (no API key needed)
- Free credits included on signup
- Access to cutting-edge coding models
- Simple pricing

## Getting Started: Two Paths

### **Option 1: Built-in Provider (Recommended)**

✅ Fastest setup, no manual configuration

1. Sign in at [**softcodes.ai**](https://www.softcodes.ai)
2. Receive free credits on sign up
3. Skip API key management entirely
4. Start coding with the **latest frontier models**

### **Option 2: Bring Your Own Provider**

⚡ More control, more customization

1. Choose from **30+ supported providers**
2. Get an **API key** from your chosen provider
3. Configure it directly in Softcodes settings

Benefits:

- Flexibility to compare costs
- Access to different model families
- Backup options if one provider goes down
- Leverage exclusive models or region-specific optimizations

## Why Use Multiple Providers?

- **Cost efficiency** → Compare usage pricing across providers
- **Model diversity** → Try different AI model capabilities
- **Reliability** → Failover if a provider has downtime
- **Features** → Some providers unlock unique features/models
- **Regional performance** → Lower latency with local data centers

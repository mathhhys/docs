title: "Task Todo List: Stay on Top of Every Step"
description: "The idea: Never lose sight of your development workflow. Task Todo Lists give you interactive, persistent checklists that live directly in your chat interface.

Why it matters: Complex projects often involve many moving pieces. Without structure, you risk skipping steps, duplicating effort, or forgetting what‚Äôs next."

### When Todo Lists Are Created

**Automatic triggers:**

- Multi-step or complex tasks
- Working inside _Architect mode_
- Workflows with several dependent phases

**Manual triggers:**

- Ask Kilo to _‚Äúuse the update_todo_list tool‚Äù_
- Say _‚Äúcreate a todo list‚Äù_

üëâ Softcodes decides the checklist content, but you can provide feedback during approval dialogs.

### Before vs. After

- **Old way:** You tried to juggle steps in your head or scattered notes, often second-guessing what came next.
- **New way:** Softcodes generates structured, auto-updating checklists that show you exactly where you are and what‚Äôs ahead.

### Where Todo Lists Show Up

1. **Task Header Summary**
   - At-a-glance progress view with your next key item.
2. **Interactive Tool Block**
   - Full checklist inside the chat where you can:
     - View all tasks and their current status
     - Edit descriptions when prompted for approval
     - Stage changes with the **Edit** button
3. **Environment Details**
   - A background _REMINDERS_ table that helps Softcodes stay aligned with current progress.

### Task Status Indicators

- **Pending** ‚Üí Empty checkbox (not started)
- **In Progress** ‚Üí Yellow dot (currently active)
- **Completed** ‚Üí Green checkmark (finished)

### FAQs

**Can I make my own todo lists?**\
Yes ‚Äî just ask Softcodes to use the `update_todo_list` tool. Softcodes, however, controls the structure and workflow.

**What about small tasks?**\
Todo lists are generally skipped for simple requests since the overhead isn‚Äôt worth it.

**Why can‚Äôt I edit the list directly?**\
By design, Softcodes manages the list to keep task tracking consistent. You give input, Kilo updates the list.

### Pro Tip: Auto-Approval

- **What it does:** Approves todo list changes automatically, no confirmation needed.
- **When to use:** Long workflows where interruptions slow you down.
- **How to enable:** Check the _Update Todo List auto-approval_ setting.
- **Trade-off:** Faster progress, but less manual control.

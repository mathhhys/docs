### Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

### Latency Performance

Response times significantly impact development flow and productivity:

- Ultra-Fast (\< 2s): Grok Code Fast 1, Qwen3 Coder
- Fast (2-4s): DeepSeek V3, GPT-5
- Moderate (4-8s): Claude 4 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1
- Slower (8-15s): Gemini 2.5 Pro, Z AI GLM 4.5

Impact on Development: Ultra-fast models enable real-time coding assistance and immediate feedback loops. Models with 8+ second latency can disrupt flow state but may be acceptable for complex architectural decisions.

#### Throughput Analysis

Token generation rates affect large codebase processing:

- High Throughput (150+ tokens/s): GPT-5, Grok Code Fast 1 
- Medium Throughput (100-150 tokens/s): Claude 4 Sonnet, Qwen3 Coder
- Standard Throughput (50-100 tokens/s): DeepSeek models, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Variable Throughput: Open source models depend on infrastructure

Scaling Factors: High throughput models excel when generating extensive documentation, refactoring large files, or batch processing multiple components.

#### Reliability & Availability

Enterprise considerations for production environments:

- Enterprise Grade (99.9%+ uptime): Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Production Ready (99%+ uptime): Qwen3 Coder, Grok Code Fast 1
- Developing Reliability: DeepSeek models, Z AI GLM 4.5
- Self-Hosted: Qwen3 32B (reliability depends on your infrastructure)

Success Rates: Enterprise models maintain consistent output quality and handle edge cases more gracefully, while budget options may require additional validation steps.

#### Context Window Strategy

Optimizing for different project scales:

| Size         | Word Count      | Typical Use Case                      | Recommended Models                     | Strategy                                        |
| :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| 32K tokens   | ~24,000 words   | Individual components, scripts        | DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 Coder               | Focus on single-file optimization               |
| 128K tokens  | ~96,000 words   | Standard applications, most projects  | All budget models, Grok Code Fast 1    | Multi-file context, moderate complexity         |
| 256K tokens  | ~192,000 words  | Large applications, multiple services | Qwen3 Coder, Grok Code Fast 1          | Full feature context, service integration       |
| 400K+ tokens | ~300,000+ words | Enterprise systems, full stack apps   | GPT-5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro | Architectural overview, system-wide refactoring |

Performance Degradation: Model effectiveness typically drops significantly beyond 400-500K tokens, regardless of advertised limits. Plan context usage accordingly.

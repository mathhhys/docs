## Benefits of Checkpoints

Checkpoints allow you to:

- Experiment with AI-suggested changes safely
- Restore your workspace to previous states
- Compare alternative implementations
- Revert to earlier project versions without losing progress

## Important Notes

- Checkpoints are **enabled by default**.
- **Git** must be installed for checkpoints to function (see installation instructions below).
- No GitHub account or repository is required.
- No personal Git configuration is needed.
- The **shadow Git repository** operates independently from any existing Git setup in your project.

## Configuration Options

Access checkpoint settings in Softcodes:

1. Click the **gear icon** → **Checkpoints**.
2. Enable or disable automatic checkpoints using the checkbox.

## How Checkpoints Work

Softcodes captures snapshots of your project using a **shadow Git repository**, separate from your main version control. These snapshots, called **checkpoints**, automatically record changes whenever tasks start, files are modified, or commands are executed.

Checkpoints track:

- File content changes
- New files
- Deleted files
- Renamed files
- Binary file modifications

## Working with Checkpoints

Checkpoints integrate directly into your workflow through the chat interface and appear in two forms:

1. **Initial Checkpoint** – marks your starting project state.
2. **Regular Checkpoints** – created after file edits or command execution.

### Viewing Differences

To compare your workspace to a previous checkpoint:

1. Locate the checkpoint in your chat history.
2. Click **View Differences**.
3. Review changes:
   - Added lines → **green**
   - Removed lines → **red**
   - Modified files show detailed line changes
   - Renamed/moved files tracked with path updates
   - New/deleted files clearly marked

### Restoring Checkpoints

To restore a project to a previous checkpoint:

1. Locate the checkpoint in your chat history.
2. Click **Restore Checkpoint**.
3. Choose a restoration option:

- **Restore Files Only** – Reverts only workspace files; chat context remains. Useful for comparing alternative implementations without losing conversation history. No confirmation required.
- **Restore Files & Task** – Reverts workspace files **and** conversation messages after the checkpoint. Requires confirmation as it cannot be undone.

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Scope**: Only changes made during active Softcodes tasks are tracked.
- **External changes**: Manual edits outside tasks are not included.
- **Large files**: Very large binary files may affect performance.
- **Unsaved work**: Restoration overwrites unsaved workspace changes.

## Technical Implementation

### Checkpoint Architecture

1. **Shadow Git Repository** – Stores checkpoint states independently.
2. **Checkpoint Service** – Manages Git operations:
   - Repository initialization
   - Checkpoint creation and storage
   - Diff computation
   - State restoration
3. **UI Components** – Chat interface elements for interacting with checkpoints.

### Restoration Process

When restoring:

- Performs a **hard reset** to the selected checkpoint commit.
- Copies files from the shadow repository to your workspace.
- Updates internal checkpoint tracking state.

### Storage Type

- Task-scoped: Checkpoints are specific to individual tasks.

### Diff Computation

- Uses Git to produce structured file differences:
  - Line-by-line changes for modified files
  - Binary files handled correctly
  - Renamed/moved files tracked accurately
  - New and deleted files clearly identified

### File Exclusion and Ignore Patterns

- **Built-in Exclusions** – ignores:
  - Build artifacts and dependency folders (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`)
  - Media and binary assets
  - Cache/temp files (`.cache/`, `.tmp/`, `.bak`)
  - Sensitive configuration (`.env`)
  - Large data files, logs, and databases
- **.gitignore Support** – respects workspace `.gitignore` files; excluded files are not checkpointed.
- **.softcodesignore Behavior** – separate from checkpoint tracking; AI access restrictions do not affect versioning.

### Nested Git Repositories

- Temporarily renames nested `.git` directories to `.git_disabled` during operations.
- Restores them afterward to maintain functionality.
- Ensures proper tracking without affecting nested repositories.

### Concurrency Control

- Operations are queued to prevent simultaneous Git actions that could corrupt state.

## Git Installation

Checkpoints rely on Git via the `simple-git` library.

### macOS

```
brew install git
# or
xcode-select --install
git --version
```

### Windows

1. Download Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Follow installer instructions (default options recommended)
3. Verify:

```
git --version
```

### Linux

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install git`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S git`
- Verify: `git --version`

Checkpoints in Softcodes provide a **non-destructive, safe, and flexible way** to experiment with AI-assisted changes, compare implementations, and restore project states with confidence.

title: "Using Modes"
description: "Modes in Softcodes are specialized personas designed to adapt the assistant's behavior to the task at hand. Each mode provides distinct capabilities, expertise, and access levels to support specific goals."

## Why Use Different Modes?

- **Task specialization:** Receive assistance tailored to the current task
- **Safety controls:** Minimize the risk of unintended file modifications
- **Focused interactions:** Get responses optimized for the activity in progress
- **Workflow optimization:** Move seamlessly between planning, implementing, debugging, and learning

## Switching Between Modes

There are several ways to switch modes:

1. **Dropdown menu:** Click the selector next to the chat input to choose a mode
2. **Slash command:** Enter `/architect`, `/ask`, `/debug`, or `/code` in the chat input
3. **Keyboard shortcut:** Use the following shortcuts to cycle through available modes. After reaching the last mode, the next press returns to the first mode.

| Operating System | Shortcut |
| :--------------- | :------- |
| macOS            | âŒ˜ + .    |
| Windows          | Ctrl + . |
| Linux            | Ctrl + . |

4. **Suggested mode changes:** Click on suggested mode switches offered when relevant

## Custom Modes

Custom modes allow creating specialized assistants by defining tool access, file permissions, and behavior instructions. These modes can enforce team standards or provide purpose-specific support. Documentation provides detailed setup instructions.

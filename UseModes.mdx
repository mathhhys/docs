Modes in **Softcodes** are specialized personas that tailor the assistant's behavior to your current task. Each mode offers different capabilities, expertise, and access levels to help you accomplish specific goals.

## Why Use Different Modes?

- **Task specialization:** Get precisely the type of assistance you need for your current task
- **Safety controls:** Prevent unintended file modifications when focusing on planning or learning
- **Focused interactions:** Receive responses optimized for your current activity
- **Workflow optimization:** Seamlessly transition between planning, implementing, debugging, and learning

## Explaining the different modes in Softcodes

### Switching Between Modes

Four ways to switch modes:

1. **Dropdown menu:** Click the selector to the left of the chat input\
   _Using the dropdown menu to switch modes_
2. **Slash command:** Type `/architect`, `/ask`, `/debug`, or `/code` in the chat input\
   _Using slash commands to switch modes_
3. **Toggle command / Keyboard shortcut:** Use the keyboard shortcut below, applicable to your operating system. Each press cycles through the available modes in sequence, wrapping back to the first mode after reaching the end.

| Operating System | Shortcut |
| :--------------- | :------- |
| macOS            | ⌘ + .    |
| Windows          | Ctrl + . |
| Linux            | Ctrl + . |

4. **Accept suggestions:** Click on mode switch suggestions that Softcodes offers when appropriate\

## Custom Modes

Create your own specialized assistants by defining tool access, file permissions, and behavior instructions. Custom modes help enforce team standards or create purpose-specific assistants. See **Custom Modes** documentation for setup instructions.

If you want, I can also **update the screenshots/inline examples** so that every reference to “Kilo Code” visually reads “Softcodes” for consistency. That would make this version fully polished.

Do you want me to do that?

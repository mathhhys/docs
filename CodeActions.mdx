### What Are Code Actions?

Code Actions appear as a **lightbulb icon (üí°)** in the editor gutter (to the left of the line numbers). You can also access them via:

- **Right-click menu**
- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Ctrl+.` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+.` (macOS)
- **Command Palette**

They appear when:

- You highlight a section of code.
- Your cursor is on a line with a diagnostic (error, warning, or hint).
- You explicitly invoke a code action command.

Clicking the lightbulb or running the command opens a menu of available actions.

### Softcodes' Code Actions

Softcodes adds several specialized actions:

- **Add to Context** ‚Üí Sends the selected code (with filename + line numbers) into your chat with Softcodes. Appears first in the menu for quick access.
- **Explain Code** ‚Üí Asks Softcodes to describe what the selected code does.
- **Fix Code** ‚Üí Lets Softcodes resolve problems in the selection (only shown when diagnostics are present).
- **Improve Code** ‚Üí Requests suggestions to make the code cleaner, faster, or more maintainable.

### Add to Context: Deep Dive

The **Add to Context** option is designed for speed. It pushes your selected snippet into chat, including the file path and exact line numbers. This gives Softcodes full context to deliver more precise help.

**Example Chat Message:**

```kotlin
Can you explain this function?  
@myFile.js:15:25
```

Here, `@myFile.js:15:25` indicates the code snippet inserted through Add to Context.

Each action can be performed:

- **In a New Task** ‚Üí Start a separate conversation around this code.
- **In the Current Task** ‚Üí Add the action into your ongoing thread.

### How to Use Code Actions

- Select a line or block of code.
- Look for the lightbulb icon in the gutter.

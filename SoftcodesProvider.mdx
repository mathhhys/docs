## Free Monthly Credits

Every user receives:

- **500 credits at signup**
- **500 fresh credits every month** (recurring)
- **Unused credits roll over** → if you don’t use all your credits, they remain in your account and stack with the next month’s allocation

💡 **Consumption depends on the model you choose.** Each model has its own cost per request, so more advanced models may consume credits faster.

## Supported Models

- Access to **450+ AI models** across multiple providers
- Includes the **latest frontier coding models**
- Model catalog is **automatically updated and maintained** by Softcodes

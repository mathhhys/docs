title: "Add Credits"
---

You can add credits directly from your Softcodes dashboard once your initial free balance runs out. Payments are securely processed through Stripe, and you only pay when you choose to top up. If you prefer, you can also connect your own API provider.

Credits are consumed at the exact API provider’s rates with no markup, commissions, or hidden fees. You pay only for what you use, and we’re working to expand support for additional LLM providers, more payment options, and flexible plans in the future.
